  Restructure Geo::WebService::Elevation::USGS
    Data_ID-to-Data_Source code.
  Tweak Geo::WebService::Elevation::USGS docs.
  Specifically require Scalar::Util 1.10, since we use
    looks_like_number().
  Use NED.AK_NED for 'bad extent' testing in t/elev.t, since
    SRTM.C_SA_3 is AWOL.
  Use only core Perl::Critic modules in t/critic.t.

  Modify BAD_EXTENT result synthesis in getElevation(), since
    the USGS changed the error that is generated when this
    happens, and since they now return mixed-case {Data_ID}.
  Modify elevation() functionality to properly compare array
    and hash source IDs to the returned {Data_ID} when the
    data are picked out of the results of getAllElevations().
  Document that the elevations returned are referred to
    NAVD88 (except Alaska, which is NAVD29).
  Make t/elev.t more robust in the face of various server
    errors.
  Bring distributed code up to perlcritic --stern with
    exceptions.
  Distribute t/critic.t and t/perlcriticrc
  Use Params::Util::__INSTANCE rather than eval{isa}. This
    adds a dependency on Params::Util 0.11.

  _Really_ recode Makefile.PL per above.
  Correct failure in t/pod.t when Test::Pod not available.
  Skip tests in t/elev.t when query returns a 5xx error.
  Try to pick up data from ActivePerl test failure.

0.002  15-Dec-2008
  Make is_valid() croak if not passed a scalar or hash ref.
  Require Test::More 0.40 (rather than 0) and recode tests
    to conform to this.
  Log all net errors encountered during tests, to try to
    diagnose test failures.
  Recode Build.PL to configure the use of Module::Build to
    the version present.
  Recode Makefile.PL in a manner corresponding to Build.PL.
  Add t/executable.t and t/manifest.t to the distribution.
