  Add the ability to use an HTTP Post request as a transport instead of
    SOAP. The transport used is selected by the 'transport' attribute,
    which defaults to 'HTTP_Post'. My current intent is to drop SOAP
    support in the next production release, and retract the 'transport'
    attribute.

  Rewrite t/elev.t to take account of the fact that the best data set
    for the test point is now 'Elev_DC_Washington', not
    'NED.CONUS_NED_13E'.  This as of approximately noon May 20 2011
    (America/New_York).
  Remove dependency on Params::Util. I was only using _INSTANCE(), and
    that is readily replaced by Scalar::Util::blessed() and
    UNIVERSAL::isa().

  Croak if $THROTTLE is set. The short deprecation cycle is because
    $THROTTLE was introduced in a development version.
  Update tests that made use of non-US data sets, since the USGS has
    apparently taken them all down.

0.005_03	27-Jun-2010	T. R. Wyant
  Remove commented-out code, rewrite regexp for clarity.
  Consolidate dependencies into inc/.../Meta.pm
  Add MIN_PERL_VERSION to Makefile.PM

  Recode throttle code to simplify, and fix bug that was causing
    throttling not to take place on every other query.
  Deprecate the $THROTTLE interface to the throttle mechanism, replacing
    it with static attribute 'throttle'.
  Test the throttle mechanism, and make it actually work under test
    conditions.

  Add authortest tests to run the normal tests without the optional
    modules.
  Add $valid argument to Geo::WebService::Elevation::USGS
    getAllElevations(), with same effect as in elevation().
  Add and test retry logic, controlled by attributes retry (which
    specifies the number of retries, defaulting to 0) and retry_hook
    (which specifies what to do before each retry, defaulting to sub
    {}). If carp is true, you get a carp on each error, but if croak is
    true it only croaks after retries are used up.
  Add $Geo::WebService::Elevation::USGS::THROTTLE, which, if set to a
    positive number, limits the rate at which this package issues
    queries, regardless of what object issues them.
  Get rid of the '; charset=utf-8' in the Content-type header.
  Have Geo::WebService::Elevation::USGS only generate a new SOAP::Lite
    when needed. Cache it, and flush the cache when relevant attributes
    change.
  Convert to CPAN-recommended license and copyright notice.
  Update README installation instructions to something much more modern
    than just expanding the tarball.
  Move author-only tests to the xt/ directory, and ditch environment
    variable machinery. inc/Geo/WebService/Elevation/USGS/Build.pm
    supplies the authortest target, which does not work under
    Module::Build.
  Do not require Module::Build for configuration, since you can always
    use Module::Build.
  Include bugtracker key in META.yml resources

  Restructure Geo::WebService::Elevation::USGS
    Data_ID-to-Data_Source code.
  Tweak Geo::WebService::Elevation::USGS docs.
  Specifically require Scalar::Util 1.10, since we use
    looks_like_number().
  Use NED.AK_NED for 'bad extent' testing in t/elev.t, since
    SRTM.C_SA_3 is AWOL.
  Use only core Perl::Critic modules in t/critic.t.

0.004  04-Jan-2009
  Modify BAD_EXTENT result synthesis in getElevation(), since
    the USGS changed the error that is generated when this
    happens, and since they now return mixed-case {Data_ID}.
  Modify elevation() functionality to properly compare array
    and hash source IDs to the returned {Data_ID} when the
    data are picked out of the results of getAllElevations().
  Document that the elevations returned are referred to
    NAVD88 (except Alaska, which is NAVD29).
  Make t/elev.t more robust in the face of various server
    errors.
  Bring distributed code up to perlcritic --stern with
    exceptions.
  Distribute t/critic.t and t/perlcriticrc
  Use Params::Util::__INSTANCE rather than eval{isa}. This
    adds a dependency on Params::Util 0.11.

0.003  19-Dec-2008
  _Really_ recode Makefile.PL per above.
  Correct failure in t/pod.t when Test::Pod not available.
  Skip tests in t/elev.t when query returns a 5xx error.
  Try to pick up data from ActivePerl test failure.

0.002  15-Dec-2008
  Make is_valid() croak if not passed a scalar or hash ref.
  Require Test::More 0.40 (rather than 0) and recode tests
    to conform to this.
  Log all net errors encountered during tests, to try to
    diagnose test failures.
  Recode Build.PL to configure the use of Module::Build to
    the version present.
  Recode Makefile.PL in a manner corresponding to Build.PL.
  Add t/executable.t and t/manifest.t to the distribution.
